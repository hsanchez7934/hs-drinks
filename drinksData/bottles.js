    description: 'Leopold Bros. Absinthe Verte is grape-based (essentially the varietals commonly found in Chilean pisco). Once the spirit is distilled with a variety of botanicals and herbs, including grande wormwood, flannel and green anise, the Absinthe Blanc is racked in used French oak barrels to rest. After a period of time in the barrel, the spirit is heated in a stainless steel container to a temperature below boiling, and a cheesecloth bag packed with roman wormwood, hyssop and lemon balm is placed in the container. The chlorophyll from the botanicals colors the absinthe green or verte. From there, the spirit is bottled and numbered by hand.'

Kübler was the first brand on the US market to come from the birthplace of absinthe in the Val-de-Travers, Switzerland and has been in continuous distillation by the same family since its origin in 1863. Its water source is Alpine Mountain Water from the Val-de-Travers, Switzerland. The same water is passed through a reverse osmosis unit for alcoholic reduction after distillation. Ingredients include wormwood, anise, fennel, artemisia pontica, hyssop, lemon balm, star anise, coriander and mint. All ingredients are sourced from local farmers in the Val-de-Travers except anise, star anise and fennel which do not grow naturally in the VDT and are sourced abroad.'

The brand calls itself the “original absinthe,” since its founder Henri-Louis Pernod helped create the first commercial absinthe distillery in 1798. In late 2013, Pernod Absinthe returned to its original formula. The spirit is now made using the same ingredients as in the early 1800s. Absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912. Pernod reintroduced its spirit to America in 2007 after it became legal again. Pernod Absinthe was created in 1805, in France’s first absinthe distillery. After years of being banned, its recipe was re-launched in 2013 based on the original formula. It includes anise, grand wormwood, petit wormwood, hyssop, and melissa, which provides anise, musk and herbaceous tasting notes. Pernod Absinthe contains no artificial dyes or sugar with the ideal serve being the traditional ritual of ice water cascading over a sugar cube. It is also the perfect ingredient to elevate a cocktail for any occasion. Pernod Absinthe won the Gold Medal in the 2014 International Review of Spirits Award and Best in Category in the 2015 Lost Angeles International Spirits Competition.'

In 1863 they changed the company name to Martini, Sola & Cia. They started exporting bottles of vermouth around the world. New York city was given its first crates in 1867. At the time the firm was awarded several prizes, which are still recorded on the bottles: Dublin (1865), Paris (1867 and 1878), Vienna (1873) and Philadelphia (1876). Just thirty years after its creation, Martini was available in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Egypt and other countries. In 1879 the Sola family sold its interests to the remaining partners, who renamed the company Martini & Rossi, as it stands today.'

Smartly bottled at over 90 proof, the flavors are clear and vibrant, and the spirit is smooth and dry. Classic style gin fans will find something to like here, with familiar botanicals highlighted along-side the saffron. Fans of contemporary gin, might find it a little less ambitious than the name might imply. Indian Summer Gin aims to appeal to both audiences, and from this vantage point looks to have pulled it off. As a preliminary rating, we like the direction here and would love to have a chance to put it to the test in a series of cocktails.'
