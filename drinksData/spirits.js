    spirit: 'ABSINTHE',
    imageURL: '/static/media/absinthe.21748362.png',
    description: 'The history of absinthe is a cocktail of myth, conjecture and controversy. A turn-of-the-twentieth-century favorite of artists and writers, the spirit was banned in the United States in 1912 because it was believed to be hallucinogenic. Just a few years ago, it once again became legal in America to buy the high-alcohol, anise-flavored liquor. The term “absinthe” comes from Artemisia absinthium, the scientific name for its key ingredient, wormwood. Long before distillers discovered it, the herb was used for medicinal purposes. The production of absinthe is much like that of gin: High-proof neutral spirit is infused with a blend of botanicals, including wormwood, and redistilled. Traditionally, the alcohol is infused a second time before bottling to intensify the flavor and create the signature green color. Many modern producers skip this final step and use dyes instead.'

    spirit: 'APÉRITIF WINE',
    imageURL: '/static/media/aperitif.749ad0c8.png',
    description: 'Apéritif wines are more than just beverages, they’re a custom long-practiced in Europe––and it only takes looking at a few bar menus to see that they’re catching on at an accelerating rate in America too. What makes a wine an apéritif is more a product of occasion, location, and the character of the food following the apéritif than the character of the wine itself. The best starting point for choosing one is with the definition of apéritif, a French word that evolved from the Latin verb aperture that means “to open.” As such, an apéritif (whether wine or not) is a drinkable appetizer meant to stimulate the appetite before a meal; it is the counterpart to the digestif that closes the meal. If you are having guests over, apéritifs are a perfect way to welcome them. So how do you choose the right apéritif? There aren’t really any rules other than choosing a beverage that’s enjoyable and intriguing to drink.'

    spirit: 'BAIJIU',
    imageURL: '/static/media/baijiu.56ab4b46.png',
    description: 'Baijiu, also known as shaojiu , is a Chinese alcoholic beverage made from grain. Báijiǔ literally means "white (clear) alcohol" or liquor, and is a strong distilled spirit, generally 52% alcohol by volume (ABV) (US: 104° proof). Báijiǔ is a clear liquid usually distilled from fermented sorghum, although other grains may be used; southern China versions may employ glutinous rice, while northern Chinese varieties may use wheat, barley, millet, or even Job\'s tears instead of sorghum. The jiuqu starter culture used in the production of baijiu mash is usually made of pulverized wheat grains. Because of its clarity, baijiu can appear similar to several other East Asian liquors, but it generally has a significantly higher alcohol content than, for example, Japanese shōchū (25%) or Korean soju (20–45%). It is closer to vodka in strength and mouth-feel. It is the most widely consumed spirit (alcohol) in the world, with 5 billion litres sold in 2016.'

    spirit: 'BOURBON & WHISKEY',
    imageURL: '/static/media/whiskey.6da813f0.png',
    description: 'Whiskey, also known as whisky, is as much a broad categorization of spirits as it is a spirit type. If you aren’t a whiskey enthusiast, you might be wondering what the difference is between whiskey and whisky, or what the deal is with whiskey versus bourbon or scotch. One determinant between whiskey and whisky is where it\'s produced. Whiskey from Ireland and the United States is usually spelled with an “e.” Whisky from Scotland, Canada, Japan and elsewhere is spelled without an “e.” So regional grammar is why you’ll see Scotch whisky but Irish whiskey on the shelves. Most whiskey distillers use the plural form whiskeys to hint that they are referring to whiskey; whereas whisky is usually pluralized as whiskies. The difference between types of whiskies like bourbon, rye or scotch is a bit more complex. Along with country of origin, the type of whiskey or whisky is also determined by the grain used in the distillation process. Different grains produce different taste characteristics. Couple that with varying distillation methods by region and producer, and you get a wide range of flavors from sweet to spicy and from smooth to bold and smokey.'

    spirit: 'BRANDY',
    imageURL: '/static/media/brandy.65e5e966.png',
    description: 'Brandy (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn, gebrande wijn or "burned wine") is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, some are colored with caramel coloring to imitate the effect of aging, and others are produced using a combination of both aging and coloring. The term "brandy" also denotes liquors obtained from the wines of other fruits. Apples, cherries, plums, pears, and peaches have all been distilled into what are called fruit brandies or eaux de vie. Pomace brandy––made using grapes with their stems, skins, and seeds––is also very common. There are many types of brandy found across the winemaking regions of the world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from France or Pisco from Peru and Chile. Brandy is generally rated by age, but the ratings vary widely by country (it is generally unregulated in the US).'

    spirit: 'CACHAÇA',
    imageURL: '/static/media/cachaca.45c87a32.png',
    description: 'Cachaça is made from cane juice pressed straight out of raw sugarcane stalks. The fresh juice is fermented and then distilled into the beloved Brazilian beverage. Some rums, usually labeled as Rhum Agricole, are made in the same way, earning cachaça the name “Brazilian rum” in certain places. The major difference between cachaça and common rum is in the juice: most rum is distilled from sugarcane juice that has been processed into molasses, which has a higher sugar content. This makes cachaça have a more grassy, herbaceous flavor than its relative.'

    spirit: 'COGNAC',
    imageURL: '/static/media/cognac.238e304f.png',
    description: 'Sip a glass of cognac and you’ll understand why the French say it’s made from l’eau de vie (the water of life). The velvety spirit is the most famous variety of brandy and is named for the area in France where it must be produced. The area around the town of Cognac, France, is divided into six grape-growing regions. The most expensive fruit comes from Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne and Borderies. Once picked, the grapes are fermented and then distilled twice in copper pot stills, which produce a colorless alcohol called eau-de-vie. The spirit is then aged in oak barrels.'

    spirit: 'GIN',
    imageURL: '/static/media/gin.3ec91ff0.png',
    description: 'Gin has been the drink of choice for statesmen, soldiers, WASPs and even the working class. It has a colorful and dramatic history, which rivals that of any other alcohol. And that’s not to mention the fact that the spirit is once again in vogue and a favorite of mixologists around the world. While the origins of the clear liquor are somewhat debatable, several hundred years ago, someone, most likely in Holland or Belgium, began to infuse alcohol with juniper berries and a variety of other botanicals. (This spirit was arguably the first flavored vodka.) Gin is still made this way today, and each brand has its own recipe and techniques for infusion. While all gin has some juniper flavor, the other botanicals can include a wide array of herbs, vegetables, flowers, fruits, spices and even tea.'

    spirit: 'LIQUEUR',
    imageURL: '/static/media/liqueur.358af419.png',
    description: 'The most varied and versatile category of spirits is arguably liqueurs, which includes everything from Baileys Irish Cream and Cointreau to Campari and Jägermeister. In the U.S., the term “liqueur” is synonymous with cordials and is derived from the Latin liquefacere, meaning to liquefy. It refers to the early Middle Ages monastic practice of extracting the essence of botanicals, which were added to base spirits and believed to have medicinal properties. Even though these concoctions all taste completely different, their basic recipe is fairly similar: alcohol and sugar (according to US law, a liqueur must contain at least 2.5 percent sugar by weight), plus spices, herbs, flowers, fruit, nuts, cream, or other flavorings. Many brands boast long histories, and a number of recipes are still secret.'

    spirit: 'MEZCAL',
    imageURL: '/static/media/mezcal.5a1a46dc.png',
    description: 'There are few spirits as misunderstood as mezcal. For one, you should never buy a bottle of the liquor if it contains a worm—those mezcals are for tourists and contain cheap alcohol. But fortunately, there’s now a growing selection of fine mezcals available in America from a range of producers. Mezcal, like its cousin tequila, is made from agave, which, contrary to popular belief, is not a cactus but is actually part of the asparagales botanical order, making it a relative of the yucca plant and Joshua tree. While tequila can only be made in the Tequila region and from just blue Weber agave, mezcal is usually produced in Oaxaca (it can legally come from anywhere in Mexico) and can be made from many types of agave, some of which only grow wild. Historically, producers used whatever agave they found locally.'

    spirit: 'PISCO',
    imageURL: '/static/media/pisco.c5bd1539.png',
    description: 'Pisco is a brandy that is the national spirit of both Peru and Chile, and fierce debate over who has appellation of origin rights continues to this day. Although Peru claims pisco must come from Peru to be labeled as pisco, the world’s largest importers allow the Chilean version to be called pisco as well. At least one thing is certain: pisco originated in the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, which contained Peru, Chile, and much of South America at the time. In the 1500s, the Spanish planted grapevines in both Peru and Chile, creating a nascent wine industry. Many of the grapes were fermented into wine and then distilled into the type of brandy now called pisco. The word translates into “bird," “river”, "valley" and “clay pot”, but when translated to mean “liquor”, it likely derived from the port town of Pisco, Peru, that once exported viticultural products. Pisco is most often made from muscat grapes distilled in copper pot stills, but a limited number of other grape varieties and production methods can be used.'

    spirit: 'RUM',
    imageURL: '/static/media/rum.4b2a244a.png',
    description: 'Rum lovers around the world owe a great debt to a simple plant: sugar cane. Hundreds of years ago, there was a sugar craze in Europe, and colonies were established around the Caribbean to make the sweet commodity. But the production of sugar creates a lot of byproduct—namely, molasses. There wasn’t much use for the thick, sticky, sweet substance until it was discovered that molasses could be fermented and then distilled. The alcohol quickly became popular with pirates, sailors and America’s founders.'

    spirit: 'SCOTCH',
    imageURL: '/static/media/scotch.3f3a7c3f.png',
    description: 'Scotch whisky will always be Scotland’s greatest export. The country’s residents have been distilling for hundreds of years, and the alcohol is some of the most highly sought-after in the world. It’s also one of the most highly regulated spirits in the world. There are just less than 100 distilleries operating in Scotland, and they all must abide by the Scotch Whisky Association’s rules. The alcohol has to be made entirely in Scotland and aged there in oak casks for at least three years and one day. Most of the casks are used bourbon barrels made of American oak. Some distilleries also age whisky in old sherry, wine and even rum casks. The final product has to be a minimum of 80 proof. After malting, the barley used for many Scotches, especially those made on the island of Islay, is dried using smoke from burning peat. This gives the finished whisky a pronounced smoky flavor.'

    spirit: 'TEQUILA',
    imageURL: '/static/media/tequila.715e8ab6.png',
    description: 'Contrary to popular belief, tequila is not cactus juice. The spirit is distilled from blue Weber agave. (And for the record, it should never come with a worm in the bottle.) Just like Champagne or cognac, tequila can only be made in a specific region: the Mexican state of Jalisco and some surrounding areas. The area’s volcanic soil is perfect for growing agave. The forbidding plant, which has sharp thorns and long, thick leaves, takes between eight and 12 years to reach maturity before it can be harvested.'

    spirit: 'VERMOUTH',
    imageURL: '/static/media/vermouth.2beea47a.png',
    description: 'The world would be a lot less interesting without vermouth. You wouldn’t be able to make a Dry Martini, a Manhattan or countless other classic and modern cocktails. So what exactly is vermouth, anyway? It’s a fortified wine—wine spiked with distilled alcohol to raise the proof—that’s flavored with herbs and spices, often including wormwood. (The name comes from Wermut, the German word for wormwood). While every brand has its own special recipe, there are two main varieties of vermouth: sweet, which is reddish-brown in color, sweetened with sugar and sometimes called Italian vermouth; and dry, which is straw-colored, typically more bitter and sometimes called French vermouth. Interestingly, nearly all vermouth actually starts as white wine: The color of sweet vermouth comes from the botanicals used, plus caramelized sugar. Both versions, according to legendary mixologist and Liquor.com advisory board member Dale DeGroff, became widely available by the end of the 19th century.'

    spirit: 'VODKA',
    imageURL: '/static/media/vodka.bad8d73d.png',
    description: 'Vodka is a chameleon and blends seamlessly with just about anything. This is no accident: While there are no universal rules for producing the spirit, the final product is supposed to be colorless, odorless and tasteless. With that said, vodka isn’t completely neutral, and a number of distillers actually leave in a good amount of flavor. (The best way to taste these subtle differences is to drink vodka neat at room temperature.) Traditionally, vodka was made from potatoes, corn or grains, but it is now made from a range of exotic bases including grapes, maple syrup and even soybeans. Unlike Scotches and cognacs, which are made in pot stills, vodka is usually produced in a high-volume, continuous column still. After distillation, the spirit is filtered to remove any remaining impurities. Coal is a traditional filter, but brands today use a range of materials, even including diamonds. Vodka isn’t aged and can be bottled and sold immediately after production. What’s also helping to drive sales in America is the wide range of flavored vodkas now on the market.'
